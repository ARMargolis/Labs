    "# Kubernetes Lab Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab can be run in various ways.\n",
    "The basic requirement is to have\n",
    "- 1 or more Kubernetes Master nodes and\n",
    "- 1 or more Worker nodes (or a 'tainted' master can serve as a worker).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to install Kubernetes on your own machine you will need to do this before the event, see Minikube for example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the lab the recommended setup is to follow the pre-provisioned Kubernetes clusters generated for you on DigitalOcean,\n",

    "However those machines will be available to you only during the lab itself (as I have to pay for them).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Setup before the event\n",
    "\n",
    "If setting up at home or work with a good internet connection you may consider some of these options before coming to this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install Kubernetes on your laptop either natively or within a virtual machine\n",
    "    - Use minikube, or minishift, to create a single-node Kubernetes cluster\n",
    "- Signup for a cloud account and\n",
    "  - Use native Kubernetes cluster creation facilities if available (Google's GKE, Azure's ACS, Amazon's EKS)\n",
    "  - Setup one or more Kubernetes nodes on VMs using kubeadm, several guides exist including [this one](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/how-install-kubernetes-kubeadm/)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Setup at the event\n",
    "\n",
    "Please do not try to download minikube or start it for the first time during the lab as this will involve downloading executables, an iso file and container images blocking the network for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use \"[Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)\" - unsure if this will scale to many users\n",
    "- Use your own Cloud account - but you will lose time to setup a Kubernetes cluster (see guide [HERE](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/how-install-kubernetes-kubeadm/))\n",

    "## 3.1 Using one of the available Kubernetes clusters on DigitalOcean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual machines have been created on DigitalOcean, with 1 VM-* per group, representing 3 Kubernetes nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* - NOTE: Normally 3 VMs would be required for this, this has been avoided through the use of [Mirantis/kubeadm-dind-cluster](https://github.com/Mirantis/kubeadm-dind-cluster).\n",
    "This should be transparent to you when running the lab - kuebctl will show 3 nodes: 1 Master and 2 Worker nodes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Credentials for connecting to your groups' VM, will be provided to you on a USB key as a zip file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure that you know your group number, e.g. group 2, and use the corresponding zip file, k8sdindg<N>, e.g. k8sdindg2.zip for group 2.\n",

    "You will find within the doceanlabs_rsa, doceanlabs_rsa.pub, doceanlabs_rsa.pem files allowing you to connect to your VM using openssh.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also find the ip address of your VM in the ssh.sh or ssh_config files within the zip file.\n",
    "Connect to the VM as user root.\n",

    "### 3.1.2 Connecting to your groups' Virtual Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are in group 2, unzip the k8sdindg2.zip file, then cd to k8sdindg2.\n",
    "From there you can connect to your VM by typing:\n",

    "```./ssh.sh ```\n",

    "### 3.1.3 Using Putty on Windows? - Generating .ppk keys for Putty\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Putty, you will be required to use PuttyGen to generate a .ppk file from doceanlabs_rsa.pem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done with the puttygen tool.\n",
    "\n",
